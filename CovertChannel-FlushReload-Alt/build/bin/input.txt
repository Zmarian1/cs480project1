This course provides an overview on the role of computer architecture and hardware in the
security of computing systems. In this course, our focus is on the attacks that are exposed by
the lower levels of the system (architecture, hardware) and conversely, what these layers can
do to secure systems. You will learn and understand fundamental hardware vulnerabilities and
how they can be exploited to implement practical attacks. These attacks include covert and side
channel attacks, transient execution (speculation based) attacks, control flow attacks, hardware
trojans, fault injection attacks, Rowhammer attacks, and attacks on emerging systems like
hardware accelerators and heterogeneous systems. You will also learn about
hardware/architecture based defense techniques to protect modern computing systems against
security threats. These techniques include defenses on microarchitectural attacks, trusted
execution environments, and hardware-supported malware detection.
